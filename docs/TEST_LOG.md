- `scripts/compile.sh` succeeds against `arduino:renesas_uno:unor4wifi` with the empty
  orchestrator (`Serial.begin()` only) and all stub modules compiled alongside it.
- `tests/run_tests.sh` passes (asserts stub placeholder behavior only — not real logic).
- No hardware connected yet; no sensor wiring performed.
